## Abstract
We propose a topological categorization of agents that makes use of the
multiple-channel logic (MCL) framework, a recently developed model of reasoning
about agents. We firstly introduce a complete formalization of prejudices on
agents’ attitudes and propose an extension of the rules of the MCL framework.
We then use RCC5 (the Region Connection Calculus) to categorize different
agents in Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) based on the collaboration, competence, and
honesty of agents. We discuss the possibility of using RCC3 and RCC8 and
generalize our results to define an upper bound on the number of different
types of agents in MAS. Finally, we apply our topological categorization to a
specific MAS that describes a Cyber-Physical System, for which we define,
categorize and discuss the resulting attack states.
